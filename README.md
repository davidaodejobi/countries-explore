## Design Description


The portrait mode, uses a Silver app bar, and I used the values gotten while scrolling to move some of the object(something I saw in a tutorial months ago). Other things are pretty much widgets with either a normal container or glasmorphic design.

For the landscape, it something I just thought of from the air, sketched it out and build. Although, there were lots of modification along the way cause there wasn't a design to follow.
## Feature would like to add ...

- I would have love to fix 2 UI bugs(minor) on the app (1. Text not responding to dark theme text in drop down when selecting localization, 2. In the landscape mode, I wrote a loop to get the project cards and I did something there that wasn't dynamic with kinda wll introduct a divider bug)

- Make animation better by reading more about how stacks and animations work.

- Add languages such as Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba in L10n.

- Try to come up with a page for work experience

## Challenges

There are two main challenges I faced while working on the task: 


- Filter without storing in a local DB or API
- Trying to build a google UI, less distracting and classic kind of animation. Combining all of those, even makes it more difficult to build and implement but thanks to Google. and Mr. Sleepless nights üñ§).

The other boss challenge is juggling the tasks with other commitments (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ).
